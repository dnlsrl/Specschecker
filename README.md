# Specschecker 2

This is a complete rewrite of the [original version](https://gist.github.com/dnlsrl/a286d202481f24e4652ad29899fefb5c), which I created while I was still unexperienced in programming with Python. It's not like I am an expert now, but I know better. If you compare both versions, you will notice that this one is better written (hopefully).

Every suggestion is welcomed, just bear in mind that I might need to research a little before being able to implement something, depending on the difficulty. PRs are also welcome! I just ask not to over clutter the script and to document it properly. Speaking of which, I tried my best to comment as frecuently and as clearly as possible so as for somebody to get the gist of the code with just a look! If you got some feedback for me in that regard, please leave me a comment as well.
